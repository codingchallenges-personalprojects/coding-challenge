## 2-	 Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.

1-	The first project was making a four-page static app, and during that project I learnt how to make a responsive app (using Media Queries). It was so inspiring for me, because responsiveness was not a requirement, but I searched and learnt how to make the app responsive.

2-	The second one was making a weather app. For the first time I learnt how to work with an API and getting data using fetch and I also learnt how to handle Js evants like click events and how to render the data on the screen. 

3-	The third one is my last personal project which I Used technologies include raw JavaScript, MVC (Model View Controller) architecture, Bootstrap, ES6 modules, asynchronous JavaScript, Axios, babel & webpack. (I used  ES6 modules, MVC, babel & webpack in an app for the first time which was so inspiring and exciting for me)

 
## 3-	If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.

I am planning to learn JS-frameworks like Vue.js and React.js. I am already studying React.js, but I have not make an app using frameworks, so I am going to make some exciting apps using React and Vue.js. Iâ€™m also very interested to learn advanced css. I will start learning them ASAP.
